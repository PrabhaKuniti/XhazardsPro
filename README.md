🌿 Project Description – StoryHealer         

🧠 Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, mental health challenges affect over 1 billion people globally, yet access to affordable and personalized emotional support remains limited. Many individuals, especially students and young adults, face stress, anxiety, and loneliness but are hesitant to seek traditional therapy due to stigma, accessibility, or cost.

💡 Our Solution – StoryHealer

StoryHealer is an AI-powered storytelling platform designed to promote mental well-being through therapeutic, interactive narratives. It analyzes user emotions and generates custom stories that uplift, comfort, or entertain—tailored to the user's mood and genre preferences.

The app not only entertains but subtly integrates therapeutic techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) patterns, uplifting themes, and interactive choices, creating a safe, imaginative space for emotional healing.

🚀 How It Works
1. User Input
The user visits the StoryHealer interface and fills out a form:

Name

Current Mood (e.g., stressed, anxious, happy)

Preferred Genre (e.g., fantasy, adventure, inspirational)

2. Sentiment Analysis
The backend uses Hugging Face’s sentiment analysis model to:

Validate or interpret the user’s mood.

Adapt the upcoming story (e.g., add positive twists if the user feels down).

3. AI Story Generation
A prompt is crafted like:

“Generate a calming fantasy story for a stressed user named Alex.”

The prompt is sent to Groq’s API (using a fine-tuned LLaMA model) which responds with a fully generated, coherent narrative in seconds.

4. Optional Visuals
If enabled, a Stable Diffusion API (e.g., via Replicate) generates AI illustrations for key story scenes, enriching the immersive experience.

5. Accessibility Features
Text-to-Speech (Web Speech API) lets visually impaired users listen to the story.

Google Translate API allows the story to be rendered in the user’s preferred language.

6. User Data & Progress Storage
Story progress and preferences are stored in Firebase Firestore, enabling session continuity and minimal setup—ideal for hackathons.
